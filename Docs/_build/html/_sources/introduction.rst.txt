Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiplayer online gaming is one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. Games like Counter-Strike, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, and so on allow multiple players to connect to a game server over the network and making their moves simultaneously to compete or cooperate in a shared game world.
In this assignment, you must develop such a real-time multiplayer game that can be played over the network. The gameplay must be real-time, meaning that the players should be able to make moves simultaneously instead of waiting in turns. It must support at least two players at the same time; whether you support more than two players is up to you. Finally, the players must be on different machines, with their copy of the game communicating with the server over the network.
The choice of game is totally up to you. Some ideas you can consider are multiplayer versions of Snake, Tetris, Agar.io, etc., though you are welcome to do anything else. Note that the updates in the game world must be controlled by the server, i.e. the player client should communicate its actions to the server, and the server should make the corresponding changes to the world, handling any potential conflicts due to asynchrony (e.g. trying to pick up an item that another player has just taken). The code can be written in any language of your choice, and the client application can be a desktop application or browser-based.
