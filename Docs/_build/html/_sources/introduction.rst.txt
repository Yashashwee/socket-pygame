Introduction

One of the most well-liked types of entertainment in the world is multiplayer online gaming. Many players can connect to a game server across the network and make simultaneous moves to compete or collaborate in a shared game environment. Some of the top games include Counter Strike, Minecraft, GTA online etc.
We have created a simple multiplayer game(desktop application) using this concept. This is a maze game which currently supports 2 players. As the name suggests, one will be runner and one is catcher ie denner. The task of the runner is to escape the maze before the denner could catch him. If the runner is unable to escape that means if the denner catches him the runner will loose and denner will win or vice versa. 
This game supports playing on different machines that is player and denner can play from different machines or even from the same machine. 
We have written an autogenerated documentation for all the important modules used in our code using sphinx tool. We have also built some testcases to check the correctness of our application using the unittest library in python. Python language is used for the implementation of this project.
